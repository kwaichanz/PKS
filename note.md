# **This is my personal note for the coding of the application**

---

1. Regarding the API calling. Could be improve by switching to SWR or Tanstack Query due to being client side or migrate fully to server sideb by remove corresponding client side's elements like useState.

2. Currently in the the application components have default code for text/image value in case the server isn't responding.

3. Working on implementing responsiveness the new NavBar.

4. A new Hero component pull out from About page requires string[] and isLoading state.
